* connect to [Collaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb) provided by Google (it require the autentication, you can use your eurac account if you do not want to sign-in);
* go to `File -> load block note -> Github` insert the repository: https://github.com/euracresearch/python-course
* once the files are open, you can execute and play with the code cell by cell, executing the cell using the â–¶ button on the page header or pressing Shift+Enter using the keyboard.
