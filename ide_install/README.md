# Installing your Python environment

## How to install Python

Python is an interpreted language. Therefore, you need to have an interpreter installed on your environment to execute it.

You can download a Python interpreter from the [Python website](https://www.python.org/).

The course material was tested using Python 3.8.X. Newer versions of Python should work but they have not been tested yet.
So, feel free to install any `python >= 3.6`.

Then follow the installation steps:

## How to install an IDE (Integrated Development Environment)

There are several ways to program and interact with Python. 
Yon can do everything using you favorite text editor and a terminal/console to execute the code.

Also, there are dedicated editors to work with programming languages, especially when it comes to programming in Python.
Some of the most used IDE (Integrated Development Environment) in the Python community are:

* [Pycharm (from JetBrains)](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
* [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/)
* [SublimeText](http://www.sublimetext.com/)
* [VisualStudio](https://code.visualstudio.com)
* [Atom](https://atom.io/)

Feel free to install and use the one that seems more interesting and helpful for your day-to-day work.

Of course, it would be easier to follow the material if all the students were using the same tool, so we could support you during all 
the planned activities.

So, we kindly ask you to install Pycharm:

After finishing the installation, you can open the IDE. You need to accept the User Agreement and to activate the license.

If you are connected to Eurac's network, Pycharm should automatically identify the JetBrains server, otherwise 
enter the following one: `http://xdclic03.unibz.it`. Test the connection and activate your license.

In the case you receive an error from the server, you can also ask for an educational 
license by registering to the [JetBrains website](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students). 
Make sure to use your e-mail from Eurac to be recognized as student. You have 30 days to use the IDE as evaluation 
while you wait for the license registration.

If you click on the `+ New project` button, then you can start selecting the type of project you want to create.
You can also specify the Python interpreter that you want to use, or to create a new one based on an existing interpreter.
